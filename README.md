Capture the Flag
================

This is a pretty basic game, but I think it may have a lot of potential.

This is a capture the flag game: one or more human players may play against an arbitrary number of AI bots. Each second, they score points according to the number of zones that they control.

This is straightforward for now but I have lots of plans for things to add Soonâ„¢ (check out todo.md).

This uses the FOSS game engine Phaser, with is a light abstraction on top of Canvas.

This was developed during a Design Patterns course at HackerU with awesome co-students during the course of just a day.
